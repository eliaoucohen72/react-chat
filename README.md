# Chat Application

## Description
This is a real-time chat application built with **React** and **Vite.js** for the client side, and **Express** with **Socket.io** for the server. It allows users to communicate in real time with unique colored message bubbles.

## Features
- Real-time messaging using **Socket.io**
- Each user has a unique color for their message bubble
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Server hosted on **Heroku**

## Special Tip: Running Two Users on the Same Computer
To simulate two different users on the same machine, you can use a VPN for one of the instances. By doing this, each instance will have a different IP address, allowing the chat to function as if two separate users are connected.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, Vite.js
- Backend: Express, Socket.io
- Deployment: Heroku

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
